Machine Learning project for predicting employee attrition.
# Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction

This project explores employee attrition using machine-learning techniques to help organizations understand and predict which employees are at risk of leaving. The IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset is used to build and evaluate predictive models.

## 📘 Project Overview
The workflow includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Handling class imbalance using **SMOTE**  
- Scaling numerical features  
- Training models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree Classifier  
- Evaluating model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision & Recall
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Curve

The goal is to identify the most influential factors contributing to employee attrition and build accurate, interpretable models.
